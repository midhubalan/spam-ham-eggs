Big Idea:
Statistics modeled in a program are easier to get right and understand than using a formulaic approach. It is also extends to more complicated situations than classic formulas
Example
=======
* Six roulette wheel spins
\-> choices with weighting
* Deal 20 playing cards without replacement (16 tens, 36 low)
\-> Counter, elements, sample, list. court
* 5 or more heads from 7 spins of a biased coin
\-> lambda, choices, list. count
* Probability that the median of 5 samples falls a middle quartile
\-> chained comparison, choices from a rannge
* Bootstrapping to estimate the confidence interval on a sample of data
\-> sorted, mean, choices
* Statistical significance of the difference of two means
\-> shuffle slicing mean
* Single server queue simulation
\-> expovariate gauss mean median stdev conditional-expressions
